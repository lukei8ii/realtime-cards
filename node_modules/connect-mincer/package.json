  "readme": "# connect-mincer\n\nThis is an Express-compatible, Connect middleware for [Mincer](https://github.com/nodeca/mincer).\n\n## What is Mincer and why do I want this?\n\nMincer is an excellent port of Sprockets, which means it is a robust and comprehensive asset manager for your Node app. However, Mincer makes no assumptions about your application so by default it requires some work to get going with a typical Express app.\n\nUsing connect-mincer, you can skip that work and simply:\n\n* Write and serve CoffeeScript, LESS, Stylus, Sass, etc\n* Have everything recompiled on each request (in development)\n* Serve files with an MD5 digest (for caching)\n* Use whatever directory structure you want\n* Precompile all your assets and have your Connect app read from the compile manifest\n\nIf you're used to the Rails asset pipeline, using this will give your Connect/Express application almost all the same capability - the only thing missing is a built-in precompile, but that's easily added (see the [example app](https://github.com/clarkdave/connect-mincer/tree/master/examples/express) for an example precompile script).\n\n## Let's go!\n\n    npm install connect-mincer\n\nNow, in your connect app:\n\n``` javascript\nvar ConnectMincer = require('connect-mincer');\n\nvar connectMincer = new ConnectMincer({\n  root: __dirname,\n  production: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',\n  mountPoint: '/assets',\n  manifestFile: __dirname + '/public/assets/manifest.json',\n  paths: [\n    'assets/css',\n    'assets/js',\n    'vendor/js'\n  ]\n});\n\napp.use(connectMincer.assets());\n\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production')\n  app.use('/assets', connectMincer.createServer());\n```\n\nThe connectMincer.assets() middleware will:\n\n* Provide js(), css() and asset_path() helpers for your views\n* In development, ensure that assets are recompiled on every request\n\nNow, in your views, you can do this:\n\n``` html\n<head>\n  <%- css('main.css') %>\n  <%- js('application.js') %>\n</head>\n```\n\nThese helpers will output something like: `<script src='/assets/application.js'></script>`.\n\nThe second piece of middleware, `connectMincer.createServer()`, sets up a Mincer server which will send the compiled version of the asset. This is great for development, though in production you'll probably want to have these files served by nginx or from a cloud host (see more about 'in production' below).\n\n## In more detail\n\nMincer and this middleware are unopinionated about where your keep your assets. When you initialise connect-mincer you pass in several options:\n\n- **root**\n  - This is usually the root of your app. Asset paths are relative to this.\n- **production**\n  - Set to true if the app is running in production mode.\n- **paths**\n  - A list of directories where your assets are located.\n- **mountPoint** *(optional)*\n  - This is what the js, css and asset_path helpers use to create the URL for each asset. Defaults to `/assets`.\n- **assetHost** *(optional)*\n  - If specified, the view helpers will generate urls of the form `assetHost + mountPoint + asset`. E.g. `//j2938fj.cloudfront.net/assets/layout.css`\n  - You should specify the protocol, i.e. `http://`, `https://` or `//`\n  - This can be used to serve assets from a CDN like Cloudfront\n- **precompileList** *(optional)*\n  - A list of assets to precompile in development. Defaults to `['*', '*/**']`.\n  - If you have a lot of individual assets which are bundled together, you may want to make this list more specific, otherwise precompiles will be slow and you may get errors (for example, if using Bootstrap, you'll get compile errors with certain .less files that are intended to be @imported only).\n  - Generally, this should be identical to the *compile* list you use during a `Manifest.compile` (see 'Precompiling' section).\n\nA typical app folder structure might be this:\n\n    app/\n      assets/\n        js/\n          application.js\n        css/\n          main.less\n          blog/\n            more.css\n        images/\n          logo.png\n      lib/\n      public/\n      vendor/\n        js/\n          jquery.js\n      app.js\n\nWith this, a suitable path list would be:\n\n    ['assets/js', 'assets/css', 'assets/images', 'vendor/js']\n\nNow anything within these paths can be referenced in your views with the helpers like so:\n\n    css('main.css')\n    css('print.css', { media: 'print' })\n    js('jquery.js')\n\nWhich would become:\n\n    <link href='/assets/main.css' type='text/css' rel='stylesheet' media='screen'>\n    <link href='/assets/blog/more.css' type='text/css' rel='stylesheet' media='print'>\n    <script src='/assets/jquery.js'></script>\n\n### View helpers\n\nconnect-mincer provides several helpers which are available in all views. All of them take an asset filename as their first argument, which is used to search for a matching asset across all asset directories (i.e. the path option provided to connect-mincer). If the asset is actually a bundle (it includes or requires other assets), all of these\nwill be returned in development mode. In production, only the bundle itself will be returned (which will include all its required dependencies concatenated within).\n\nIn all cases, the urls returned here will contain their MD5 digest if the app is running in production.\n\n#### js(path, attributes) -> One or more script tags\n\n* filename (String) The filename of the asset relative to its asset directory\n* attributes (Object) An object containing attributes for the `<script>` tag\n\nLooks for a matching JS asset and returns `<script>` tag with the `src` attribute set. Additional attributes can be provided as the second argument.\n\n#### css(path, attributes) -> One or more link tags\n\n* filename (String) The filename of the asset relative to its asset directory\n* attributes (Object) An object containing attributes for the `<link>` tag\n\nLooks for a matching CSS asset and returns a `<link>` tag with the `href` attribute set. Additional attributes can be provided as the second argument - by default it will have `rel='stylesheet' media='screen'`.\n\n#### asset_path(path) -> One or more asset urls\n\n* filename (String) The filename of the asset relative to its asset directory\n\nLooks for any matching asset and returns the url to access it, e.g. `/assets/logo.png`. If the filename is a bundle, and the app is in production, an Array of urls will be returned instead.\n\n## In production\n\nFor production use, connect-mincer lets you pass in a Mincer manifest file and will use this to generate correct asset paths (with MD5 digests). Precompiling is easy, using Mincer.Manifest, and there's an example of this below. For now, let's assume you have precompiled your assets to the `/public/assets` directory. This directory will contain a `manifest.json` file which links asset filenames to their digest format.\n\nIf you pass the manifest file to connect-mincer, e.g:\n\n    manifestFile: __dirname + '/public/assets/manifest.json',\n\nWhen the helpers (js, css, asset_path) are called in your views, connect-mincer will look up the compiled name in the manifest and use that, leading to an output like this:\n\n    <script src='/assets/application-4b02e3a0746a47886505c9acf5f8c655.js'></script>\n\nwhich will correspond to the file `/public/assets/application-4b02e3a0746a47886505c9acf5f8c655.js`. Now you can set nginx up to intercept requests to `/assets` and serve the static file in `/public/assets` instead. Thanks to the MD5 digest, you can set the cache headers to maximum. The next time you deploy and precompile the digests will change, and your app will adjust its `<script>` and `<link>` tags accordingly.\n\n### But I want to use Node to serve my static assets\n\nOK, cool, you can do that. After precompiling all your assets are ordinary static files in `public/assets`, so you can use the `connect.static` middleware to serve them like any other static file. You can also use the `connect.staticCache` middleware to speed it up for production.\n\n``` javascript\napp.use(connect.static(__dirname + '/public'));\n```\n\n## Precompiling\n\nBecause this is a middleware, it doesn't provide anything special to handle precompiling. But that's OK, because it's easy to do with Mincer so you can create your own custom precompile routine (e.g. a grunt task).\n\nA simple precompile script:\n\n``` javascript\nvar Mincer = require('mincer');\n\nvar env = new Mincer.Environment('./');\nenv.appendPath('assets/js');\nenv.appendPath('assets/css');\nenv.appendPath('vendor/js');\n\nvar manifest = new Mincer.Manifest(env, './public/assets');\nmanifest.compile(['*', '*/**'], function(err, data) {\n  console.info('Finished precompile:');\n  console.dir(data);\n});\n```\n\nThis will precompile everything in the `assets/js`, `assets/css` and `vendor/js` directories. You can pass in more specific paths to `manifest.compile()` if you only want certain things to be included.\n\nIf you were to run this from your root app directory, it would create the folder `/public/assets`, populate it with the compiled versions of all your assets, and create a manifest file suitable for passing to connect-mincer.\n\nA more substantial example of a precompile script is part of the express example app, [here](https://github.com/clarkdave/connect-mincer/blob/master/examples/express/bin/precompile_assets.js).\n\n## I want to know more about Mincer (bundles, custom engines, helpers)\n\nMincer is, like Sprockets, really powerful. The [Mincer documentation](http://nodeca.github.com/mincer/) has you covered.\n\nconnect-mincer supports anything Mincer does, so bundles and supported engines will all work out of the box. If you want to do more custom things, like adding helpers for your assets to use, you can add them directly to the Mincer Environment:\n\n``` javascript\nvar connectMincer = new ConnectMincer({ ... });\nconnectMincer.environment.registerHelper('version', function() {\n  return require(__dirname + '/package.json').version;\n});\napp.use(connectMincer.assets());\n```\n\nThis will add a `version` helper which will be available in any asset, to be used like so:\n\n``` javascript\napp.version: '<%= version() %>';\n```\n\nMincer supports helpers in EJS and Stylus. Fortunately, even if your asset is something else (e.g. CoffeeScript, LESS), you can attach the EJS processor to it and have variables too by appending `.ejs` to the file. Mincer processes a filename from right to left, so the file:\n\n    css/main.less.ejs\n\nwill first be processed by EJS (resolving things like `<%= version() %>`) and then LESS itself.\n\n**Note:** any modifications to the environment *must* be done before the connectMincer.assets() middleware is called. When the app runs in production mode, the environment is set to a read-only index (for speed), so any modifications must be done before this happens.\n\n# Contibuting\n\nAll feedback or contributions are welcome!\n\n# Changelog\n\n- *2013-05-03*: added `assetHost` option for serving assets from a specific host\n\n# TODO\n\n- add tests\n- add built-in helpers like Rails & Sprockets, like:\n  - asset-path, asset-data-uri, image\n\n# Licence\n\n[MIT](https://github.com/clarkdave/connect-mincer/blob/master/LICENCE)\n",
